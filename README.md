# Interview Preparation Guide

There are a lot of information available online to practice, and I will encourage you to make use of that. 
This is a collection of resources for someone getting into CS or doing interview prep.

Even though this guide is targeted more for folks preparing for interviews, it's a good guide to get into CS fundamentals as well.

# Basics

## CS Fundamentals

This [Youtube Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8dPuuaLjXtNlUrzyH5r6jN9ulIgZBpdo) by CrashCourse contains A-Z fundamentals in a very easy to understand language but if you don't have time, at least start with these two:

1. [Intro to Algorithm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rL8X2mlNHPM&list=PL8dPuuaLjXtNlUrzyH5r6jN9ulIgZBpdo&t=0s)
2. [Intro to Data Structure](!https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuDz6B4cqVc&list=PL8dPuuaLjXtNlUrzyH5r6jN9ulIgZBpdo&t=0s)

## Data Structures

Here are some common Data Structures and even though some features of these DS can vary by language, most of them exist with similar properties.

1.  [Arrays](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~adamchik/15-121/lectures/Arrays/arrays.html) 
2.  Strings
3.  [Linked List](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/linked-list-set-1-introduction/) - Pay attention to how to define a node.
4.  Hash tables
5.  Stack and Queue
6.  Tree - Including Binary Search Tree
7.	Heaps

## Some Common Algorithms & Concepts

1.  Recursion	
2.	Breadth-first search, depth-first search
3.	Quicksort, merge sort
4.	Binary search
5.	2D arrays
6.	Dynamic arrays
7.	Binary search trees
8.	Dynamic programming
9.	Big-O analysis

## Design Topics

1.	HTTP (at the protocol level)
2.	Databases (indexes, query planning)
3.	CDNs
4.	Caching (LRU cache, memcached, redis)
5.	Load Balancer

# Practice 

Now that you have hopefully revised your concepts, lets start practicing some questions. 
Even though your depth of knowledge is the most important thing, practicing some interview questions is extremely important.
Most interviews are 45 min to an 1 hour. In that time, you have to understand the problem, find the optimal algorithm and write code. 
So its essential to practice keeping that in mind.

I advice folks starting out to follow these simple steps:

1. Pick a problem
    * Start with some easy's and medium's problems on different topics
2. Solve the problem
    * Take your time solving the problem initially even if it takes you more than an hour. 
    * Use an IDE at first to make sure the problem runs
3. Test your code
    * Get in a habit of writing some basic test and try different input to see how your code responds.
4. Compare your solution
    * Now that you have a solution, look up the optimal solution and see whats the difference between your code and the optimal solution.
5. Identify the gap
    * If you got the right solution, pat yourself on the back, if not, thats what this step is about, learn from the solution and see 

As you get more comfortable solving the problem and start to get more optimal solution, make these two changes:

1. Time yourself
    * Most of the times, you will get only 30-40 min to solve a problem in the interview, so time yourself and try to get your time to solve the problem under 30 min.
    * You can *even* repeat the problems you have already solved and see if you can now do them under the time limit.
2. Practice on a Notepad.
    * Remove the IDE and get comfortable writing code on a notepad.
    * Only write the main method / function and see if your code compiles.
3. Do Mock interview
    * Pick a friend or contact me and get yourself comfortable with the process and stress of the interview.

To help you get started, here is a [beginner guide](Beginner.md) with some common problems broken by topic to pick from. 

# Interviewing Resources
* [Base Cs](https://medium.com/basecs/tagged/data-structures) 
* [Tech Inteview Handbook](https://yangshun.github.io/tech-interview-handbook/) 
* [GeeksForGeeks](https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/home/)
## Websites with algorithm problems
* [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/explore/)
Plenty of problems here, with varying difficulty. Doesn't always have "official" answers though.
* [firecode.io](http://firecode.io/)
Similar to LeetCode, but better answers and feedback.
* [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com)
Also similar to LeetCode and firecode.io
## Learning resources
* [Interview Cake](https://www.interviewcake.com)
Good, but not a lot of content
* Element of Programming Interviews - A great book. Highly recommend.
* Cracking the Coding Interview - Good book, but not as good as Elements of Programming Interviews (in my opinion).
* [Grokking the System Design Interview](https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-the-system-design-interview)
## Mock interview services
* [interviewing.io](https://interviewing.io) 
Good website for having mock interviews. Also allows you to have anonymous interviews with REAL companies too.
* [Pramp](https://www.pramp.com)
Another mock interview service. Maybe not as high quality as interviewing.io, but more interviews available.
* [Gainlo](http://www.gainlo.co) - Paid mock interview service
