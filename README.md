# Interview Preparation Guide

There are a lot of information available online to practice, and I will encourage you to make use of that. This is a collection of resources for someone getting into into CS or doing interview prep.

Even though this guide is for folks preparing for interviews, its' a good guide to get into CS fundamentals as well.

# Basics

## CS Fundamentals

This [Youtube Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8dPuuaLjXtNlUrzyH5r6jN9ulIgZBpdo) by CrashCourse contains A-Z fundamentals in a very easy to understand language but if you don't have time, at least start with these two:

1. [Intro to Algorithm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rL8X2mlNHPM&list=PL8dPuuaLjXtNlUrzyH5r6jN9ulIgZBpdo&t=0s)
2. [Intro to Data Structure](!https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuDz6B4cqVc&list=PL8dPuuaLjXtNlUrzyH5r6jN9ulIgZBpdo&t=0s)

## Data Structures

Here are some common Data Structures and even though some features of these DS can vary by language, most of them exist with similar properties.

1.  Arrays 
    * [Intro](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~adamchik/15-121/lectures/Arrays/arrays.html) 
    * [Common Question List](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/must-do-coding-questions-for-companies-like-amazon-microsoft-adobe/#arrays)
2.  Strings
    * [Anagram](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/string-data-structure/#anagram)
    * [Palindrome](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/string-data-structure/#palindrome)
3.  Linked List
    * [Intro](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/linked-list-set-1-introduction/) Pay attention to how to define node.
